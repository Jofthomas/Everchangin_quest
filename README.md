It was once a peacefull village untill one day a portal appeared out of the blue. The portal in the center of the village leads to an everchanging dungeon. Not much is known. it is speculated that in order to save the town, someone has to climb all the way up the to the last level of the portals. The portals bring fortune but also a lot of misery. Hence greedy adventurers often come to try and conquer them. Will someone ever be able to end all of this?

As a courageous young adventurer, you're the hope of saving the village. Before starting your adventure, arm yourself and ask the locals any questions you can think of. Who knows? They may be able to guide you in your quest. Beware, the world beyond the portal will never be the same. 

Kill your enemies to collect gold and find your way to the end.

In this game nearly everything than can be generated from LLM is made as such.

For this Game Jam I kept thinks simple with only a few tiles available. But the story is dynamically generated from those tiles thanks to gemini 1.5 pro.

The current scope of possible available  objects is relatively limited but the code can be "Expanded" to have an unlimited number of stories soon.
